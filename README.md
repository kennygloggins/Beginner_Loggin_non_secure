# Beginner_Loggin_non_secure
A practice program to simulate a login prompt but it isn't secure. Will come back to make secure when I learn how to.

Login_non_secure.py:
  -My first attempt, used on the command line and with a txt file.
  -txt file name needs to be 'logandpass.txt' to store and read usernames and passwords.
   You can change the name of the files it uses on lines 12 and 44

Tkin_test.py:
  -My second attempt using a gui this time and sqlite.
  -Uncomment lines 23 and 24 for the first time you run so a table can be made
   named uandp.
  -Comment out lines 18 and 19 or change the file location to a picture you'd like to use
   for the window icon.
